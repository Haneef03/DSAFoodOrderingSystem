Introduction

The Food Ordering System is a command-line application developed in C++ that allows users to register, log into their accounts, browse available food selections, create new orders, and cancel orders that haven't been prepared yet.
Features
1. Register and Login

Users can create a new account by providing their details such as username, password, and contact information. They can then log into their account using their registered credentials.
2. Browse Food Selections

Once logged in, users can view a list of available food items along with their descriptions and prices. This feature helps users decide what they want to order.
3. Create New Order

Users can create a new order by selecting food items from the available list. The system will calculate the total cost of the selected items and provide a summary before confirming the order.
4. Cancel Order

If an order hasn't been prepared yet, users have the option to cancel it. This feature helps customers make changes to their orders or cancel them entirely.
